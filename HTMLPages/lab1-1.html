    When you view a page in your browser, you are seeing the interpreted code that you type into your text editor. Web pages are made up of text which is calleds "marked up", or formatted using hyper text markup language or HTML. The HTML codes, known as tag, are placed around the text that you want to format. In most case, when formatting text, you will have both an opening and a closing tag to indicate where the formating should start and end

    Content on a web page is contained inside elements. There are basically two types of elements,block and inline. This content is being written inside a paragraph element, which is a block element because there will be space above and bellow the parragraph essentially blocking it off from other content <strong>however this content is in a strong element,which while inline  elements do not seperate their content</strong>.Block elements will effect a page layout, where inline elements will not.
