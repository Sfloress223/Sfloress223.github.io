 <p>A web desinger is an individual that makes their living by designing and maintaning web sites. This is a field that has evoled exremely quickly over that past decade, but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any wev desinger must have a string understanding of the HTML language. Conrtay to what most people belive HTML is not a programing language, But a formatting language developed by Tim Burners-lee in 1989. Since its original development HTML has come a long way and has incorporated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the World Wide Web and the explosive popularity of the internet!</p>   
 <p>As HTML evolved, developers soon relized that the structure of web pages should be defined using HTML, and the page style, look and feel, should be defined separately, thus the birth of cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the informatuin on the web page is,such as a heading content, article content, a paragraph within an article, or a footer content, etc Cascading sheets were designed to define the color of documents, the size, margins, colors, and the positioning of the various elements of the web page.</p>   
  <p>About the time the HTMl and the World Wise Web were hitting the public sector, PHP was being develped to make web pages more pwerful tool. PHP is a scripting language that is written directly on the webpage and interpreted by the web server which would send final version of the web page to the visitor's browser. About a year later <strong>Netscape</strong> released the first version of JavaScript, under the name mocha which later became LiveScript, and then JavaScript. JavaScript is also a scripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted by the visitors browser rather than the web servers. As a final result JavaScript is not as powerful as PHP and lackks the ability to interact with a database, but still provides processing functionality to a web page. Web desingers now days must not onlt be profcient in HTML and CSS, but a variety of scripting langauges as well. Even thiugh HTML was the first language of the web, many more have come along, but it still remains the fundamental structure that the web page is built from.</p>
