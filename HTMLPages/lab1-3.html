<strong>Article 1:</strong>This selection will have two articles grouped together. This section containers are used to group other elements together, usually for positioning purposes so we will use them more in the later lessons. Elements may also be grouped  together in a selection to so that the area of the page grouped by the section can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as this example.     
</article>
<article style ="background-color: #ffffcc">
<p><strong>Article 2:</strong>The articles do not necessarily have to go inside the selction, however if the article are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be positioned or sized together, you can acheive this by placing both in a single section and formatting each section. The articles will inherit the formatting applied to the section
